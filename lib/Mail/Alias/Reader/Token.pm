=head1 NAME

Mail::Alias::Reader::Token

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Mail::Alias::Reader::Token is not only the class represents an aliases(5) parser
token, but also itself is returned by L<Mail::Alias::Reader> as a representation
of a mail alias destination.  For the purposes of this documentation, only the
public-facing methods which facilitate the usage of instances of this class
shall be discussed.

=head1 DETERMINING MAIL DESTINATION TYPE

A variety of methods are provided to allow one to infer the type of a mail
alias (parser token) returned.

=over

=item $destination->is_address()

Returns true if the mail destination described by the current token is a local
part or fully qualified mail address.

=cut

sub is_address {
    return shift->isa('T_ADDRESS');
}

=item $destination->is_directive()

Returns true if the mail destination described by the current token is a
mail transfer agent directive.

=cut

sub is_directive {
    return shift->isa('T_DIRECTIVE');
}

=item $destination->is_command()

Returns true if the mail destination described by the current token is a
command to which mail messages should be piped.

=cut

sub is_command {
    return shift->isa('T_COMMAND');
}

=item $destination->is_file()

Returns true if the mail destination described by the current token is a file
to which mail messages should be appended.

=back

=cut

sub is_file {
    return shift->isa('T_FILE');
}

=head1 CONVERTING THE MAIL DESTINATION TO A STRING

=over

=item $destination->value()

Returns a parsed and unescaped logical representation of the mail alias
destination that was originally parsed to yield the current token object.

=cut

sub value {
    return shift->{'value'};
}

=item $destination->to_string()

Returns a string representation of the mail alias destination that was
originally parsed to yield the current token object.

=back

    # Since not every token type has a "value", per se, lazy evaluation is
    # necessary to prevent a Perl runtime warning when evaluating the 'T_COMMENT'
    # part of this hash when dealing with tokens that are anything other than a
    # comment.

# Mail::Alias::Reader::Token->tokenize_for_types($buf, @types)
#
# Transform the given text buffer, $buf, into a series of tokens, based on the
# rules passed in @types (defined near the top of this file).  Returns an ARRAY
# of tokens that were matched based on the rules in @types versus the input
# buffer.
#
# As the token types are associated with their parsing rules, and are given in
# an ordered manner, proper precedence can be followed and ambiguity in lexing
# can be overcome.
#
# This method does not provide the main tokenizing interface; rather, it only
# facilitates for the easy access of a single pass of tokenizing, and is called
# by the Mail::Alias::Reader::Token->tokenize() method.

# any statements not inside double quotes, though while grabbing double-quoted
# statements and holding onto them for a later second pass.  During this second
# tokenization pass, performed for each double-quoted statement found and in the
# order of first-stage tokenization, statements containing spaces are parsed.
#
# Since this method is intended to be used on a single line of input, a T_BEGIN
# and T_END token comes as the first and the last token returned, respectively.
